- 💻 Use of **HTML** and **CSS** for page creation and decoration
- 🎉 Use of **Bootstrap** for grid alignment for the various panels and posts

## To Improve for V2
- [ ] Import new npm packages (as many that were used for this project are deprecated) 
- [ ] Update the front end (it is very flat, but lacks skeumorphism that would really make it look nice)

## Sources and Attributes
- FontAwesome for all the icons used in the project
